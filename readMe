How to Run the Project:

Prerequisites:
Create a MongoDB database.
Update your credentials in the .env file.

Backend Setup:
Navigate to the backend project directory.
Run the following commands:
npm install   // Install dependencies
npm run start:dev   // Start the backend server

Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend project directory.
Run the following commands:
npm install   // Install dependencies
npm run dev   // Start the frontend application

User Creation:
Create two users, one as an admin and the other as a client user:
Use a POST request to BaseLink+"/api/auth/register" with the following body parameters:
{ "email": "yourEmail", "password": "yourPassword", "role": 0 } for the admin user.
{ "email": "yourEmail", "password": "yourPassword", "role": 1 } for the client user.

Note:
Adoption requests initiated by clients are processed through the web interface.
Admins exclusively manage and approve these requests through the API (this part is not implemented on web interface).
