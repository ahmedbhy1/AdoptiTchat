How to Run the Project:

Prerequisites:
Create a MongoDB database.
Update your credentials in the .env file.

Backend Setup:
Navigate to the backend project directory.
Run the following commands:
npm install   // Install dependencies
npm run start:dev   // Start the backend server

Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend project directory.
Run the following commands:
npm install   // Install dependencies
npm run dev   // Start the frontend application

User Creation:
Create two users, one as an admin and the other as a client user:
Use a POST request to BaseLink+"/api/auth/register" with the following body parameters:
{ "email": "user1Email", "user1password": "yourPassword" } and { "email": "user2Email", "password": "user2Password" }.
By default, users are created as clients. To designate one as an admin, update the user's role in the user collection in MongoDB. 
(the admin need to have access to the db). 

Note:
Adoption requests initiated by clients are processed through the web interface.
Admins exclusively manage and approve these requests through the API (this part is not implemented on web interface).
