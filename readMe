About:

AdoptiTchat' is a platform that allows users to browse and adopt cats, inspired by AdopteUnMec. 
It features a user-friendly interface where visitors can view available cats, mark favorites, and send adoption requests. 
Admins can manage the list of cats by adding, editing, or removing entries, all while ensuring smooth adoption processes. 
The platform is built with React on the front-end and a JavaScript framework of choice on the back-end.


How to Run the Project:

Prerequisites:
Create a MongoDB database.
Update your credentials in the .env file.

Backend Setup:
Navigate to the backend project directory.
Run the following commands:
npm install   // Install dependencies
npm run start:dev   // Start the backend server

Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend project directory.
Run the following commands:
npm install   // Install dependencies
npm run dev   // Start the frontend application

User Creation:
Create two users, one as an admin and the other as a client user:
Use a POST request to BaseLink+"/api/auth/register" with the following body parameters:
{ "email": "user1Email", "user1password": "yourPassword" } and { "email": "user2Email", "password": "user2Password" }.
By default, users are created as clients. To designate one as an admin, update the user's role in the user collection in MongoDB. 
(the admin need to have access to the db).
